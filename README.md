# Notepad-by-me
# This is a notead that I created with just python 3 and the Tkinter module.
# so you obviously need python 3.
# And also, this is my first Github repository so please, be nice. :)
# This is just your basic notepad with the button functions: openFile, saveFile, Exit, and clearFile.
# I think you cannot open the file by itself and, you need to open it using Unix Terminal, PowerShell or, Cmd.
# for unix terminal, python3 notepad.py
# and for Windows Powershell or Cmd, python3 (insert repo here then, \notepad.py at the end.)
